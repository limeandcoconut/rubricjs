# Rubric.js

## Rubric Underpins Better Reusability In Components

An es6 component, entity, system, framework with a minimal core. Rubric was designed with a verbose syntax and naming scheme that focuses on ease of use and clarity. This standpoint was largely inspired by Douglas Crockford's comment to the effect that code is meant to be read by humans and incidentally run by machines.

Testing and dev are done with babel in es6.
